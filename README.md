# 🔐 Password Manager Web App

A full-stack **Password Manager** built from the ground up by me — a Computer Science student exploring how secure applications are truly made.
This is **not just another form-and-save project**, nor is it an incomplete prototype. It's a complete system built following every major step of a production cycle.

### 🚧 Built From Scratch (Following these setps to production):
- 📐 **Database Schema Design**
- 🔧 **Backend API Development (Spring Boot)**
- 🔐 **Encryption & Hashing (AES + BCrypt)**
- 🎨 **Frontend UI Construction (React + Tailwind + Bootstrap)**
- 🔗 **Frontend–Backend Integration**
- 🧪 **Testing & Debugging**
- ☁️ **Deployment on AWS (RDS + EC2)**

## 🔌 API Endpoints

### 🔑 AuthController

| Method | Endpoint            | Description |
|--------|---------------------|-------------|
| POST   | `/api/auth/signup`  | Register new users. Passwords are **hashed using BCrypt** before saving. |
| POST   | `/api/auth/login`   | Login users and return a **JWT token** upon successful authentication. |

### 🔐 PasswordDetailsController

| Method | Endpoint                          | Description |
|--------|-----------------------------------|-------------|
| POST   | `/api/password/addpassword`       | Add new credentials. Passwords are **AES-encrypted** before storage. |
| GET    | `/api/password/getallpasswords`   | Fetch all saved credentials for the authenticated user. |
| DELETE | `/api/password/deletepassword`    | Delete a password entry by ID. |
| PUT    | `/api/password/updatepassword`    | Update existing credentials (re-encrypts with AES if password is changed). |

> 🔐 All routes (except login and signup) require a valid **JWT** in the `Authorization` header.

## 🧠 Security Architecture

- **JWT Authentication** – Secures endpoints and ensures stateless user sessions
- **BCrypt** – Hashes user login passwords for safe storage
- **AES Encryption** – Encrypts each saved password; only decrypted when fetched
- **CORS + Spring Security Filters** – Ensures only verified users can access or modify data

---

## 🌐 Hosting (AWS Cloud)

- 🔁 Spring Boot backend runs on an **Ubuntu EC2 instance**
- 🔐 Secured with **NGINX reverse proxy** (optional HTTPS setup)
- 🗃️ **MySQL database** hosted on **AWS RDS**
- 🧠 Application managed with **systemd service**

---

## 🚧 Planned Improvements

- [ ] Password strength meter
- [ ] Secure password generator
- [ ] Chrome/Browser Extension
- [ ] Forgot password reset mechanism
